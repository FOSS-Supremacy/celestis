# Game Design

Celestis is an open-world 2D universe simulator inspired by Solar 2, on this game you control celestial bodies, build solar system empires and evolve.

## Mechanics

You start as an asteroid and need to hit other asteroids to grow your mass and become a planet, this planet will make orbits with closer asteroids.

You can keep these orbits or absorb them to increase the mass of your planet, asteroid collisions will increase the planet mass.

After some mass, the planet will start to evolve life, this process will take 10 seconds, if some asteroid hit the planet, the process is restarted.

Once the life evolution is finished, the planet will spawn spaceships and bullet towers in the surface, after 10 seconds a protection shield will be created.

This shield protects against asteroids, bullets and missiles, the shield has a HP bar that is decreased with these hits.

Each planet can spawn 10 spacechips, these spaceships follow the planet orbit and protect it, if other life planets are added, they will protect the solar system from enemies.

A star with 4 planet orbits will have a protection shield.

The star only make orbits with planets and absorb them to increase the mass, the mass quantity will change the star color from yellow to red.

After some mass, the star will become a neutron star or black hole after a supernova.

The supernova explosion will destroy any solar system closer.

## War

A closer solar system with life planets will be neutral or violent, you can choose the diplomacy profile of your solar system empire, peace or war.

In the "peace" profile it prefer to do commerce and build diplomacy, while the "war" profile attack any neutral solar system.

Planets where the enemy destroy the protection shield, will become part of the enemy, thus you will have an internal enemy on your solar system.

The same applies for you, by destroying the enemy's planets, you grow your galatic empire.

## Diplomacy

You can request a war alliance with some solar system, it has a 50% of probability of success or fail, if it's failed you need to wait 30 minutes to request again.

Once some solar system empire has an alliance with you, you will share the same enemies.

After 15 minutes some solar system empire will betray some member of the alliance.

The AI also make their war alliances.

## Spaceships

The spaceships fly around the mother solar system, planets will spawn these spaceships:

- Attack ship - Fire bullets with small damage
- Missile ship - Fire auto-guided missiles with medium damage
- Laser ship - Fire a laser with high damage

## Multiplayer

Each player will control their celestial bodies, the processing will be done on the host.
