# Celestis

A space game inspired by [Solar 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/97000/Solar_2/)

## Motivation

Solar 2 is a great and fun game, but it's too simple and lacks multiplayer.

We plan to expand the Solar 2 idea to another level.

## Goals

- Reallistic celestial bodies
- Reallistic lighting and gravity
- Life evolution on planets
- Planet management
- Spaceships management
- Solar system buildings
- Alliances
- Wars

## Game Design
